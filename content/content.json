The only rule of the exercise is to not stop. Just keep moving. Can be very slow movements. Anything can be a flow toy. Provide 20 different random items (ribbon on string, one sqoop, juggling scarves, regular fans, slinky, kitchen tools, etc). Guests get 1-2 minutes to flow with their item, then they must swap to a different item. 10 rotations, exercise is 10-20 mins."
